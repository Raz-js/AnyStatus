## AnyStatus
Get your own sweet custom discord status!
Paste your account token in `token.yaml` and your desired presence text in `text.yaml`. Those files can be opened using the normal Notepad. You can find your discord token [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEgFvgg7ZPI).
You need to have Python installed to use AnyStatus.
Next,  open a new terminal in the current folder and execute the following command:

 Then open main.py and your custom status is ready :)
